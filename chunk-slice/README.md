# Chunk Size and Slice Example

* Requirements: `SciDB 15.12`
* Usage: `iquery --afl query.afl`

Assumes SciDB is running on the localhost on the default port and no authentication is required. Running the query results in three new arrays, `foo`, `bar`, and `taz`. In the `query.afl` file, the commented out `slice` query runs for a long time.

The [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) provided is used to test that the example runs successfully. The Dockerfile builds a Docker image. It starts from a SciDB image, adds the example code, and runs the example code. If the Docker image is built successfully, we conclude that the example ran successfully. The build results can be viewed on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rvernica/scidb-examples/builds/). On each particular build, the *Logs* section (mid-way), contains the output generated by the example.
