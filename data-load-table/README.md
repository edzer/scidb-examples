# Data Loading Example

* Requirements: `SciDB 15.12`
* Usage: `iquery --afl query.afl`

Assumes SciDB is running on the localhost on the default port and no authentication is required. Running the query file results in four new arrays, `rec_file`, `rec_head`, `rec_body`,  and `rec`.

The [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) provided is used to test that the example runs successfully. The Dockerfile builds a Docker image. The build starts from a SciDB image, adds the example code, and runs the example code. Finally, it compares the output from running the example query (`query.afl`) with with the expected output (`test.gold`). The build fails if the two outputs differ. The build results can be viewed on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rvernica/scidb-examples/builds/). On each particular build, the *Logs* section (mid-way) contains the output generated by the example.
